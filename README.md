## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS selectors
- Flexbox
- Media queries
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to use the css selector nth-child()

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.nutrition-info tr:nth-child(4) th {
  border-bottom: none;
}

.nutrition-info tr:nth-child(4) td {
  border-bottom: none;
}
```

### Continued development

- HTML Semantics
- Specific naming of classes for easy comprehension

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for CSS selectors. I really liked the selector and will use it going forward.
